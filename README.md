# Ethereum Block Explorer

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things
  
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum blockexplorer. 

### Start the webserver

`npm start`

Running the command above will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The webpage will automatically reload when you make code changes.

What you'll see in the browser is Ethereum Mainnet's current block number.
